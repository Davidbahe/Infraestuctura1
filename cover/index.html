    <h1>The impact of cloud services on IT infrastructure </h1>
    <p class="lead">Cloud computing has become the most relevant and efficient solution during the pandemic for organizations. Some of the large internet service providers have been some of the biggest beneficiaries.
</p>
<br>
<p class="lead">With storage devices have been able to identify major advances in the technology, they have made the life of the community simpler and have become more efficient for all the use that is given to it. For example, three decades ago you had to use cassettes to listen to music, and you had to buy one by one of cassettes of your favorite artists. If you have one in consequence you must had a big device at home to listen all this music, or if you had a portable device, you had to carry this in your backpack, in addition to carrying the tapes.
</p>
<br>
<p class="lead">Nowadays people do not have to record all the songs with the microphone of the cellphone to enjoy and sing the melodies of these; this was happening ten years ago when we have the most popular models of Sony, Motorola, and Nokia cell phones. Now, people can carry their mobile devices and their headphones anywhere, these two devices do not weigh more than two pounds in your pocket and mobilization is not complicated, although, these can also be lost very easily, but this another way from the topic. The quality of music today is authentic, it offers a simple and intuitive service to use and does not require a large budget to access all services. For example, Spotify is a “Software as a Service” that incorporates thousands of songs in the cloud, is in charge of providing a service of “Live Streaming” Music or Podcasts around the world, just a click away. 
</p>

    <p class="lead">
      The cloud cab be defined as large-scale computational resources. This means that there is a union of processing, internet, and storage at high download and upload speed rate of information and can be consumed according to customers.  Major companies can work simultaneously, and they do not have a crash during the process; due to their system is ready to have millions of users at the same time; the cloud allows companies to adopt new positions in a highly competitive environment. They way in which the business is managed respect to time, knowledge and decisions. 
    <\p>
      
 <br>
      <p class="lead">
        In terms of costs, the companies take a weight off their shoulders, in addition to not having to buy a physical infrastructure in their facilities, they do not have to spend money on DATACENTERS, besides the fact that these are quite expensive to maintain. In this case it is done by a third part specialized in all cloud infrastructure. You can see how operating costs decrease for the company. It brings good benefits; they could hire personnel to maintain in management these data and not as when it has a physical infrastructure. In case of loss of damage, the companies that provide this service have the possibility of take a backup of information, but in case it cannot be recovered, the company providing the service is liable for the damages caused.
      </p>
            
 <br>
      <p class="lead">
        One of the relevant aspects, the cloud provides accessibility with agile adaptation to the environment of work in which It seeks to determine and find services in which the highest possible workload can be established.
      </p>
       <br>
      <p class="lead">
       Cloud servie help companies to have their information decentralized. They help the company to achieve scalability and depending on its architecture they can establish quality parameters; like it is used with AWS and have relevant changes when they can exchange information with the client. Although it can also be seen as a double-edged sword in which they must be restricted to the terms and conditions of these services. 
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="lead">
        For those companies that do not have a stable internet connection, cloud services often fail or do not work efficiently, but in these cases it has been possible to intervene today with the services provided to anticipate such incidents and have integrated solutions to prevent the loss of information in interruptions of workflows, such as Google Docs tools, a simple example in which if there is a failure in the internet there is a label that advert your status offline and this ask you if you want to work in mode offline or return to the last state until the internet connection is restored. 
      </p>
      <br>       
      <p class="lead">
        Data in Cloud is not safe, there may be leaks of information and distribution of malware, but in no case are that exempt from this, whether using hybrid, physical infrastructure, or everything with access, they only provide a service and if you compare, you can not blame a car for the accident because in principle the responsible party is the one who gives it the use and access to the information. 
      </p>
      <br> 
      <p class="lead">
        The cloud service works as a SOA service bus in which it provides different services for different entities, since this is responsible to show the best work environment and the possibilities of using it in which small and medium enterprises can expand their business and not only how to take into account the architecture data storage, It would allow Its customers to use the service with a quick response and in theory is a stable system  for all who use it, as it is guaranteed more than 98% of the time in operation of this and when it is in “Stand by mode there is a prior notice by the service providers.
      </p>
       <br> 
      <p class="lead">
        Cloud service turns out to be one of the best alternatives fot those who cannot afford a high range infrastructure and your business is not focused on this kind of things, because you can omit the implementation of this to invest this money in a better way and achieve more progress in your organization. Also allows to talk about the principal KISS and keeps them out of the simple uncomplicated and in the future may be recommended to hire the services IAS (Infrastructure as a service) that because to its services will have better management in their information and improve the effectiveness by putting the contracted company in charge.
